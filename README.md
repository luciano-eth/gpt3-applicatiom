### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
This is my first GPT3, tried a lot of different things, ultimately decided to go with a app that analyze the ingredients of any given product. For example your preferred shampoo (mine is Shea Moisture) or even the food you consume. 
A little bit about the app - i had to link it through an OpenAI API and add keys for Railway.app to be able to access OpenAI.
